 NGO Project for promoting e commerce and reducing decieveness in India<br />
 
Reduced fraudulent registration cases in real estate in India with the help of CUBA Builder NGO by automating the registration process.<br />
The customer has to pay a minimal amount of Rs. 100000 as the registration money which would ensure that no fake customers are being registered at builder's site. This money would be returned after the allotment of houses.<br />
Registration requires the signature as well as some personal details including the house booking details which is kept private from the outside world. Thus along with the money, these other registration details would ensure no fake bookings.<br /> 
The payment is taken using SBI portal in accordance with the society permission.<br />
